The program must support the following:

class Movie - models a movie which includes
- movie name
-movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
- watched - the number of times the movie has been watched

class Movies - models a collection of movie objects

Obviously, Movies needs to know about Movie since it is a collection of Movie object
However, out main driver should only interact with the Movies class.

For example, a simple main should be able to 
- create a Movies object
- ask the Movies object to add a movie by providing the movie name, raiting and watched count
- ask the Movies object to increment the watched count by 1 for a movie given its name
- ask the Movies object to display all of it Movies

Additionally,
- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the movies collection
we should display this error to the user
- if we try to increment the watched count for a movie whose name is not in the movies
collection we should display this error to the user
