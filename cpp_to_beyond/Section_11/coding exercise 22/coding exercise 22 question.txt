    CODING EXERCISE 22: FUNCTIONS AND PROTOTYPES - CONVERTING TEMPERATURES

    In this exercise you will create a program  that will be used to convert Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius
    and Kelvin temperatures through the use of two functions.

    For this program, assume that temperature will be represented as a double value. 

    Begin by defining the the function prototypes for the functions fahrenheit_to_celsius and fahrenheit_to_kelvin
    which are both passed a double value and return a double value.

    Now, at the bottom of the file , write the full definitions of both functions.

    The function fahrenheit_to_celsius is passed a Fahrenheit temperature and returns a rounded Celsius temperature.
    You may use the <cmath> function round in order to round the return value. The formula to convert Fahrenheit to
    Celsius is (5.0 / 9/0) * (temperature - 32).

    The function fahrenheit_to_kelvin is passed a Fahrenheit temperature and returns a rounded kelvin temperature.
    The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin is (5.0 / 9.0) * (temperature - 32) + 273.

    Remember the rules of PEDMAS when defining the body of your functions.

    Now, from the temperature_conversion function, declare and initialize the variables celsius_temperature
    and kelvin_temperature by calling the appropriate functions which you have just definied and passing the
    variable fahrenheit_temperature.
