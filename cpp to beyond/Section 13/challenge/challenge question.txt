Section 13 Challenge
===================

For this challenge you are to develop the foundation for a program
for movie fanatics to keep track of what movies they have watche
and how many tim they watched each movie.

The program must support the following:

class Movie - models a mvie which includes
- movie name
- movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
- watched - the number of times the movie has been watched

class Movies - movies a collection of movie objects

obviously, Movies needs to know about Movie since it is a collection of Movie objects
however, out main driver should only interact with the Movies class.

For example, a simple main should be able to 
- create a Movies class object
- ask the Movies object to add a movie by providing the movie name, raiting and watched count
- ask the Movies object to increment the watchedcount by 1 for a movie given its name
- ask the Movies object to display all the of its movies

Additionally,
- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the movies collection
we should display this error to the user
- if we try to increment the watched count for a movie whose name is not in
the movies collection we should display this error to the user
