CODING EXERCISE 21: USING FUNCTIONS FROM THE CMATH LIBRAY

Using Functions from the cmath Library

In this exercise you will create a program that will be sued as a POS (Point of Sale) 
system in a restaurant. The bill_total
is given as well as the number_of_guests. The 5 guests will be splitting the bill 
evenly and so the individual_bill will be
bill_total / number_of_guests.
The POS will be sued in three different locations, each with different guidelines 
for printing bills.

At location 1, individual_bill_1 always rounds down to the nearest dollar.
At location 2, individual_bill_2 always rounds to the nearest dollar.
At location 3, individual_bill_3 always rounds up to the nearest cent.

Determine what the individual_bill will be at each of the locations.

Begin by declaring and initializing individual_bill.
Now, declare and initialize individual_bill_1 by using <cmath> function floor 
with individual_bill as the argument.
Next, declare and initialize individual_bill_2 by using the <cmath> fuction 
round with individual_bill as the argument.
Finally, declare and initialize individual_bill_3 by using <cmath> function 
cell with individual_bill as the argument. In order to 
round individual_bill_3 to the nearest cent, you must multiply the argument 
of the function ceil by 100 and then divide the result
of the function by 100.
