Implementing a Recursive Function - Save a Penny

in this exercide you will create a program that calculates the total_amount money
that will be accumulted if you start with a penny and double it everyday for n
number days.

e.g.
Day 1: $0.01
Day 2: $0.02
Day 3: $0.04
...
...
...
Day 16: $327.68
Day 17: $655.36
Day 18: 1310.72

For this program, assume that all money will represented as a double value and
so a penny will be represented as 0.01.

Begin by completing the function prototype a_penny_doubled_everyday which is passed an int and
a double. Now that the function prototype is declared, at the bottom of the file define the
function.

The function should return the total_amount accumulated after n number of days. For example,
if n=18, the function should return 1310.72. The function should be able to calculate the
total_amount for any number of days starting with any aount however the default amount 
should be a penny.

Now, from the function body of amount_accumulated, declare and initialize the variable 
total_amount by calling the a_penny_doubled_everyday function for n=25 days.
